bio: >-
  Network engineer who learned more in my home lab than I did in most classrooms.
  I lead healthcare network migrations (75+ switches, zero downtime), specializing
  in Cisco infrastructure and Python automation. My lab is where I test everything
  before production—new protocols, automation scripts, weird edge cases. If I can't
  break it at home, I'm confident deploying it at scale. CCNA and Network+ certified,
  DePaul Network Engineering grad, always building something.
