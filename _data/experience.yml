  desc: I lead network infrastructure modernization for a multi-hospital healthcare system on a 5-year engagement, directing 75+ switch migrations across 10+ hospital locations. Working with Cisco Catalyst and Nexus platforms, I architect and execute Layer 2/3 cutovers while coordinating onsite engineering teams through live implementation in mission-critical environments. I've maintained zero unplanned downtime across all deployments by owning the full cutover lifecycle—from pre-staging and validation through implementation and post-migration stabilization. To accelerate deployments and eliminate manual errors, I built a Python automation toolkit using Netmiko and CLI parsing that cuts post-migration validation time by 3+ hours per cutover. I've also standardized deployment methodologies across the distributed hospital network by creating reusable MOPs, validation runbooks, and port-mapping templates that reduce project risk and enable consistent implementations.

  dates: Jun 2022 - Dec 2022
  desc: Fresh out of college with a Network Engineering degree, I took this role to get my foot in the door while hunting for the right network engineering opportunity. I provided desktop and systems support for 45+ clients in a fast-paced MSP environment, managing everything from Windows/MacOS endpoints to Active Directory, Exchange Server, and O365 administration. I led employee onboarding workflows including account provisioning, security access configuration, and hardware deployments across diverse client environments. I also supported email security operations by responding to phishing incidents and managing spam gateway systems. While the role wasn't networking-focused, it taught me how to work under pressure, manage multiple clients simultaneously, and communicate technical issues clearly to non-technical stakeholders—skills that translate directly to coordinating network cutovers with hospital staff today.

  desc: During my time at DePaul, I worked part-time as the primary technical resource for a 2-person MSP supporting small business clients. As the only tech on staff, I handled everything—hardware troubleshooting, software deployments, basic network infrastructure, and client communications. I deployed and configured endpoint security solutions like SentinelOne, managed network equipment procurement through Dell, and handled router/switch installations and wireless access point deployments for small office environments. I also provided monthly executive briefings to business owners, translating technical concepts into business value and budget recommendations. While the networks were small (no VLANs, mostly unmanaged switches), this role taught me how to be the go-to person for all things IT, manage client expectations, and troubleshoot problems independently—all while balancing a full course load in Network Engineering.
